The world clearly doesn't have enough blog engines, so I wrote my own.

My [static file generator](https://github.com/christofjans/blogengine) compiles the [Markdown Sources](https://github.com/christofjans/sitesrc) and outputs the [HTML files](https://github.com/christofjans/christofjans.github.io) . 

The blog is viewable [here](https://blog.christofjans.com).
